# CS1430 Final Project: An Improved WebGazer Using Neural Networks 

We improve WebGazer by using a neural network with grayscale 24x24 pixel eye patches as input. The output is then scaled and combined with the pupil position from clmgazr to predict gaze. 

A nonfunctional, but running version of the model is included in the codebase.
